# aui-ng

aui-ng is a set of components which have the purpose to simplify the integration between AUI and Angular.JS.
The library is still under heavy development and is considered in an experimental state. So be aware that
things will change rapidly and tests still need to be written.

## Installation

```
bower install aui-ng --save
```

## Components

### Dialog

Standalone Dialog service which can be used as replacement for AUIs Dialog1 and Dialog2.
In general it is more flexible than Dialog1/2 and fits better into the angular world.

### Page

A set of directives which can be used to create pages and panels. Think of the Dialog1 pages and
panels feature but as standalone directives and not coupled to the dialog scenario.

### DatePicker

A directive which maps to `AJS datepicker`

### Select2

A directive which maps to `AUI Select2

### Tooltip

A directive which maps to `AJS tooltip`
